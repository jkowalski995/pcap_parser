# *.pcap parser

This is the simple *.pcap files parser made by using the PySimpleGUI.

I made this as my own one-day coding challenge. 

## This repository consits of 3 files:
- `gui.py` witch is the main app witch generate the GUI and ask user for providing the data
- `analyzer.py` in this file are located functions responsible for parsing the *.pcap file
- `live_cap.py` where is shown a possibility to sniff packets on-air like in Wireshark
